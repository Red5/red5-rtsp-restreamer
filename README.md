red5-rtsp-restreamer
=============

Example code for Red5 server which demonstrates how to stream from an RTSP source (Specifically an Axis camera) to a live Flash media stream. The code was developed by Andy Shaules and donated to the Red5 project by [Infrared5, Inc](http://infrared5.com/). This repo is no longer maintained by the Red5 open source team.

[Red5 Pro Server](https://www.red5pro.com/red5-pro-server/) provides and maintains a newer more capable plugin for your RTSP or MPEG-TS needs.
